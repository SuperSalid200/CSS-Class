 <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: oblique; font-weight: 600;">"Suffer as I have"</p>
 <p style="font-style: oblique; font-size: 18px;">Ramattra's story is one of hardships, trauma, and a magnified view of humanityâ€™s harsh realities.While created as a war machine, Ramattra has only ever wanted to create a better future for omnics.As the leader of Null Sector, Ramattra enjoys incredible support from his people, and is primed to impose his philosophies on the world. What his goals might cost, however, remains to be seen.Because of their precarious situation, Ramattra believes that omnics should only care about their own kind, and never consider humanity in their struggle for survival. He is not above working with humans however.Despite their divergent paths, he remains fond of Zenyatta, and believes there is no omnic in the world who understands him better (though Nameless is a close second).Despite being his creator, Ramattra despises Anubis.
Ramattra is mostly emotionally reserved, but his anger can boil over while in battle. His Nemesis form is a product of his own design; a product of his genius mind, and the manifestation of his rage.He uses it sparingly however, as he prefers tactical precision to brute force.</p>
